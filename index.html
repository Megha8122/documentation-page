            <p>JavaScript is an object-based scripting language which is lightweight and cross-platform. JavaScript is not a compiled language, but it is a translated language</p>
            <p>JavaScript is a scripting or programming language that allows you to implement complex features on web pages — every time a web page does more than just sit there and display static information for you to look at — displaying timely content updates, interactive maps, animated 2D/3D graphics, scrolling video jukeboxes, etc. — you can bet that JavaScript is probably involved. It is the third layer of the layer cake of standard web technologies, two of which (HTML and CSS) we have covered in much more detail in other parts of the Learning Area.</p>
            <p>JavaScript is a scripting language that enables you to create dynamically updating content, control multimedia, animate images, and pretty much everything else. (Okay, not everything, but it is amazing what you can achieve with a few lines of JavaScript code.</p>
            <p>JavaScript is commonly used for creating web pages. It allows us to add dynamic behavior to the webpage and add special effects to the webpage. On websites, it is mainly used for validation purposes. JavaScript helps us to execute complex actions and also enables the interaction of websites with visitors..</p>

                <h2>JavaScript and Java</h2>
            </header>
            <p>When JavaScript was created, it initially had another name: <q>LiveScript</q>. But Java was very popular
                at that time, so it was decided that positioning a new language as a <q>younger brother</q> of Java
                would help.</p>
            <p>But as it evolved, JavaScript became a fully independent language with its own specification called
                ECMAScript, and now it has no relation to Java at all.</p>

        <section class="main-section" id="variables">
            <header>
                <h2>Variables</h2>
            </header>
            <p>Most of the time, a JavaScript application needs to work with information. Here are two examples:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>An online shop – the information might include goods being sold and a shopping cart.</li>
                <li>A chat application – the information might include users, messages, and much more.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>Variables are used to store this information.</p>
            <p>A variable is a <q>named storage</q> for data. We can use variables to store goodies, visitors, and other
                data.</p>
            <p>To create a variable in JavaScript, use the <code>let</code> keyword.</p>
            <p>The statement below creates (in other words: <em>declares</em>) a variable with the name <q>message</q>:
            </p>
            <div>
                <p><code><span>let</span> message;</code></p>
            </div>
            <p>Now, we can put some data into it by using the assignment operator <code>=</code> :</p>
            <div>
                <p><code><span>let</span> message;<br>message = 'Hello';</code></p>
            </div>
        </section>

            <header>
                <h2>Data types</h2>
            </header>
            <p>A value in JavaScript is always of a certain type. For example, a string or a number.</p>
            <p>There are 8 basic data types in JavaScript.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><code>number</code> for numbers of any kind: integer or floating-point, integers are limited by
                    ±(2<sup>53</sup>-1)</li>
                <li><code>bigint</code> is for integer numbers of arbitrary length.</li>
                <li><code>string</code> for strings. A string may have zero or more characters, there’s no separate
                    single-character type.</li>
                <li><code>boolean</code> for <code>true</code>/<code>false</code></li>
                <li><code>null</code> for unknown values – a standalone type that has a single value <code>null</code>.
                </li>
                <li><code>undefined</code> for unassigned values – a standalone type that has a single value
                    <code>undefined</code>.
                </li>
                <li><code>object</code> for more complex data structures.</li>
                <li><code>symbol</code> for unique identifiers.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section class="main-section" id="strings">
            <header>
                <h2>Strings</h2>
            </header>
            <p>In JavaScript, the textual data is stored as strings. There is no separate type for a single character.
            </p>
            <p>The internal format for strings is always <span>UTF-16</span>, it is not tied to the page encoding.</p>
            <h3>Quotes</h3>
            <p>Strings can be enclosed within either single quotes, double quotes or backticks:</p>
            <div>
                <p>
                    <code>
                        let single = 'single-quoted';</code><br>
                        <code>let double = "double-quoted";</code><br>
                        <code>let backticks = `backticks` ;
                    </code>
                </p>
            </div>
        </section>
